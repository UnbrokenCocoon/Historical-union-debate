# 🗨️ Historical Dialogue: Trade Unionism Then and Now

This fictional dialogue stages an imagined conversation between two trade union organisers — one from the early 20th century, and one from the early 21st century — to explore evolving views on welfare, sickness benefits, and union organising. All responses are grounded in archival and contemporary material.

### 🧵 Dialogue

> 🔴 **Historic Union (c.1920s):**  
> Listen here, we need more than just provisions for sickness; our members deserve protection against poverty *during* sickness! We must fight for comprehensive benefits, not just a meagre handout.  
> *--------------------------------------------------*

> 🔵 **Modern Union (c.2020s):**  
> Absolutely, we need to go further than mere provisions; our members deserve comprehensive benefits to combat poverty caused by illness, not just a paltry handout. Let's fight for a fairer benefits system, a national campaign to protect our safety net.  
> *--------------------------------------------------*

> 🔴 **Historic Union (c.1920s):**  
> Brother, we've been fighting for improved sickness benefits for years, and our members need more than mere "paltry handouts." A national campaign for comprehensive benefits is precisely what we should be pushing for.  
> *--------------------------------------------------*

> 🔵 **Modern Union (c.2020s):**  
> Look, we're already actively supporting members facing benefit issues, and our campaign is expanding to fight benefit sanctions. A national campaign is exactly what we need to win better sickness benefits for everyone.  
> *--------------------------------------------------*

> 🔴 **Historic Union (c.1920s):**  
> Our union already aids members with benefit problems, so a national campaign is redundant; we should focus our efforts on improving existing support. Expanding our current efforts is far more efficient than starting something new.  
> *--------------------------------------------------*

### 📊 Generation Pipeline

This dialogue was generated using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline built in Python, incorporating:

- Sentence-transformer embeddings (`all-mpnet-base-v2`)
- FAISS vector search
- Gemini Pro LLM (via LangChain)
- Role-specific system prompts simulating different eras of union discourse

### 📝 Data and Ethics

- **Historic materials** were sourced from the **Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick**, which houses extensive archival collections on trade union history.
- **Modern materials** were based on public campaign texts and newsletters from UK-based unions.
- For ethical reasons, all union identities have been anonymised.

This project aims to reflect how language, priorities, and strategies have evolved in union contexts — without revealing internal or sensitive institutional affiliations.
